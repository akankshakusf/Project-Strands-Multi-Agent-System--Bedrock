### Recommendation: HOLD/ACCUMULATE

## Actionable Insights

1. **Portfolio Strategy**: Maintain Apple as a core technology holding with a balanced growth-value profile
2. **Entry Points**: Set buy limits at 10-15% below current trading levels for accumulation during market corrections
3. **Risk Management**: Maintain appropriate technology sector allocation limits (typically no more than 25-30% of equity portfolio)
4. **Income Strategy**: Apple's dividend yield remains modest, but consistent growth supported by strong FCF makes it suitable for dividend growth strategies
