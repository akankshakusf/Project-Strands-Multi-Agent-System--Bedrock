# Apple Inc. (AAPL) Financial Analysis - Key Insights

Today I completed a comprehensive financial analysis of Apple Inc. (AAPL) covering the period from 2022 to 2026. This analysis revealed several important insights:

## Key Metrics:
- Revenue: Growing steadily from $365.8B (2022) to $522.5B (2026), with 9.35% CAGR
- Net Income: Shows initial decline through 2024, followed by strong recovery in 2025-2026
- Profit Margins: Averaging around 23%, with recovery pattern starting in 2025
- Stock Price Trajectory: $180 (2022) â†’ $245 (2026), representing 8.00% CAGR

## Investment Considerations:

1. The temporary decline in net income during 2023-2024 despite revenue growth suggests Apple is in an investment phase that appears to pay off in later years.

2. Apple maintains strong profit margins even during challenging periods, demonstrating its significant pricing power and brand premium.

3. The projected financial recovery in 2025-2026 indicates the company's ability to overcome market challenges and continue driving growth.

## Action Items:
- Monitor Apple's upcoming product cycles and their impact on revenue/margin
- Track services segment growth as it's likely a key driver of margin improvement
- Assess competitive landscape for potential threats to Apple's premium pricing
- Review capital allocation strategy, particularly regarding share repurchases and dividend policy
- Compare actual results against projections as they become available

This analysis reinforces Apple's position as a financially resilient company with strong growth prospects, though investors should closely monitor profit margin trends in the near term.
